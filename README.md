# Audit Server

This project provides a lightweight way to collect and view system audit reports. A Bash script
gathers metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, open ports and running services, then
writes the results to JSON files. A small web frontend served by Nginx lets you browse these
reports over time.

## 🚀 Installation

1. 📥 Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/audit-server.git
   cd audit-server
   ```

2. 🧰 Install dependencies

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y bc jq curl lm-sensors sysstat
   ```

   You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you plan to run the bundled server.

3. ▶️ Generate your first audit

   ```bash
   ./generate-audit-json.sh
   ```

## 🛠️ Requirements

The `generate-audit-json.sh` script relies on a few common utilities:

- ⚙️ `mpstat` and `bc` for CPU statistics
- 📦 `jq` for JSON formatting
- 🌡️ `sensors` for temperature readings (optional)
- 🌐 `curl` to retrieve the public IP address

Make sure these commands are available on the machine where you run the script.

## 🧾 Generating an audit

The script stores reports under `/home/damswallace/docker/audits-nginx/audits` by default. You can
override the location by setting the `BASE_DIR` environment variable before running:

```bash
./generate-audit-json.sh
```

Each execution creates an `audit_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.json` file inside `archives/` and updates
`index.json` with the list of available reports. You can schedule the script via cron to capture
snapshots at regular intervals.

## 📂 Managing reports

Run the lightweight Node server and use the web interface to create or remove audits:

```bash
node server.js
```

The dashboard exposes buttons to generate a fresh report or delete the currently selected one.
Each action updates `archives/index.json` automatically.

## 🌐 Serving the reports

`server.js` serves the `audits` directory and provides the `/api/reports` endpoint used by the UI.
It also exposes a `/healthz` path that returns `{ "ok": true }`, which is convenient for Docker
health checks or reverse proxies such as Traefik. When containerized, expose port `8080` and point
Traefik or any other proxy at that port. Start it with the command above and open
`http://localhost:8080/` in a browser. The included `docker-compose.yaml` can still be used if you
prefer an Nginx setup.
