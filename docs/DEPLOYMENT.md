# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to serve audit reports through Nginx running in Docker with Traefik.

1. Generate audits (or schedule the script):

   ```bash
   ./generate-audit-json.sh
   ```

   Reports are stored under `/home/damswallace/docker/audits-nginx/audits/archives` by default. Use `BASE_DIR` to
   change the location.

2. Start the container:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

The `docker-compose.yaml` mounts the audit directory and `nginx.conf`, exposes port 80 on the `br-dams` network
and sets Traefik labels for routing `audit.damswallace.fr`. Adjust paths, network settings or labels to fit your
environment.
